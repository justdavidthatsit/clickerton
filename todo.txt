i wonder if github works now idk new to this XDD

1. make a thing that gets the last time/date that you closed the //
window, then calculates how much cps you would have made at a 
fraction of that cps as a penalty for having the game closed

2. an upgrade that makes your individual clicks weaker, but if
you click and hold and perfectly time a letgo, it charges and
releases a burst of clicks that count for more. the more amount
of points put into this skill, the more value the burst gives on
success (this can be done with an if-check or switch case idk)

3. a save system, lmao 

✅. a system letting you multiply the amount of cps gained by 
mice by like .2 or someshit

✅. this is a reminder that on the multiplier, the first upgrade 
should ALWAYS be +1 or something to double production, onwards u 
should do some more math on that (maybe start multiplying? idk)
MULTIPLY THE MULTIPLIER!!!!
(example, if m is at 1.4 lets say, if u multiply it with an
upgrade that gives u 20% more production, you'd do 1.4 X 1.2 to
get 1.68, which is 20% more of 1.4)

5. make a pixel font thats easily readable and apply it
everywhere

✅. add some checks on the name so its,
    - not too long
    - not too short
    - has no funny characters
  OHH AND DURING CONFIRMATION, THE PERSON UR TALKING TO CAN HAVE
  LIKE DIFFERENT REACTIONS TO EACH IFFY THING SAID LIKE

  >enter nothing
      - ".. hello?"
  >enter the funny characters
      - "never heard of someone with '?,/,<,>,=,[,],`,~,+' in their
       name before haha"
  >continue clicking like 50 times and maybe get a hidden achievement for being such a
      - "sir just any normal name will do"

7. a minigame where you press z and x in whatever order it asks for, fanfiction writing



potential bugs:
change name after intro to nothing
